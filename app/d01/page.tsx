        title="When Logic Takes a Backseat to Love"
        body="The love is that it makes absolute fools out of geniuses and poets out of people who can barely spell “romantic.” It turns calm, logical humans into detectives who analyze every emoji like it’s a secret code, and suddenly a three-word text can decide your entire mood for the day. Love makes you say “I’m fine” while your brain is writing a 12-chapter novel titled “Why I’m Definitely Not Fine.” You start missing someone you saw five minutes ago, replaying conversations like they’re your favorite songs, and even a random song on shuffle feels about them. It’s hilarious, really — love is the only emotion that makes you lose your mind and call it beautiful. ❤️"
