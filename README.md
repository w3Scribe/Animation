# Animation Starter Project

A clean and simple Next.js + TypeScript starter project designed for experimenting with web animations. Use this as a foundation to build, test, and learn animations using popular libraries like GSAP, Framer Motion, or custom CSS/JS motion techniques.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project provides a minimal setup to:

- Experiment with different animation libraries and techniques
- Learn animation concepts in a modern React/Next.js environment
- Build interactive and animated web experiences
- Test and compare various animation approaches

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/w3Scribe/Animation.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Animation

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### Development Server

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
